# Experimental Cascading
This is a folder for providing an experimental scalding/cascading build. <br>
We want to e2e test a hadoop3/cascading4 fork of cascading here.

# Cascading WIP
The WIP branches of cascading are a pain to consume because they only publish to github-packages which requires github auth to read. 
It's easier to just compile to WIP branch here before a final release of cascading 4.5 is available.
